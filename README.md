# Protocol_NonCanonicalSwitch
It contains the MATLAB codes to run high-throughput bifurcation analysis for noncanonical bistable switches.
In the zip file there are three directories for three different types calculations and one directory for the data relevant to the figures of the manuscript.
'Bifurcation1p' directory contains the MATLAB codes to perform 1-p bifurcation using pseudo potential energy of the ppMISA network.
'ParameterSearch' directory contains the MATLAB codes to perform parameter search for bistable switches by sampling parameters randomly. 
'PhaseDia' directory contains the MATLAB codes to perform phase diagram calculations of a bistable switch.
'SimulationData' directory contains the MATLAB data for figures reported in the STAR Protocols.
